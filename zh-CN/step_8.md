## 造型

Use what you've learnt in this project to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like — look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
play note (60) for (0.25) beats
```

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

You can use more sprites from the library, and you can also paint your own sprites!

## title: 当角色切换造型时为什么会“跳一下？

当你创建自己的角色时，你可能会发现当你点击角色，他在切换造型时会“跳一下”。这是因为两个造型的中心不在同一位置上。

To fix this, make sure that the centres of your sprite's costumes are the same.

If you have a microphone, you can record your own sounds, and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments!
