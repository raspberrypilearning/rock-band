## Atores

Antes de começar a codificar, você precisará adicionar uma 'coisa' ao código. No Scratch, essas 'coisas' são chamadas de **atores**.

\--- task \--- Open a new Scratch project.

**Online:** open a new online Scratch project at [rpf.io/scratchon](http://rpf.io/scratchon){:target="_blank"}.

**Offline:** open a new project in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

It looks like this:
