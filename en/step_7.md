---- task ---
Add more instruments to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like â€” look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
play note (60) for (0.25) beats
```

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

when [space v] key pressed
```

title: Why is my sprite 'jumping' when it changes costume?
---

When creating your own sprite, you may find that when you click the sprite, it 'jumps' as it changes costume. This is because the two costumes aren't centered in the same place.

To fix this, make sure that the centres of your sprite's costumes are the same.
