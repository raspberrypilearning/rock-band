## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Scratch: Module 1](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-module-1) pathway, you can move on to the [Lost in space](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lost-in-space?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project. In this project, you will do create a space-themed animation.

Or, why not try out another [Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch) project.
