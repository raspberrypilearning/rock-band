## Costumes

Now you will make your singer look like she's singing! Change how your singer sprite looks when it's clicked by creating a new costume.

Click on the Costumes tab, and you'll see the singer costume.

Click on the new costume (called 'Singer2'), and then select the line tool and draw lines so it looks like your singer is making a sound.

The names of the costumes aren't very helpful at the moment. Type into the text boxes of the costumes to change their names to 'not singing' and 'singing'.

Now that you have two different costumes for your singer, you can choose which costume is displayed! Add these two code blocks to your singer sprite:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
+switch costume to (singing v)
play sound (singer1 v) until done
+switch costume to (not singing v)
```

The code block for changing the costume is in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} section.
