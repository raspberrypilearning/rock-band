Open a [new Scratch project](http://rpf.io/scratch-new){:target="_blank"}.

It looks like this:

![A screenshot of the Scratch programming interface. The interface has a purple top bar with options such as "File," "Edit," and "Share." On the left, there is a code blocks panel, with blocks for "Motion," "Looks," "Sound," "Events," and other categories. The "Motion" section is expanded, showing blue blocks with commands like "move 10 steps," "turn 15 degrees," and "go to random position." In the center is a blank coding workspace. On the right, the Scratch Cat sprite is visible in a preview area, with controls for sprite properties like "x," "y," "size," and "direction" below.](images/band-scratch.png)
