You can change how your singer sprite looks when it's clicked by creating a new costume. Click on the Costumes tab, and you'll see the singer costume.

Click on the new costume (called 'Singer2'), and then select the line tool and draw lines so it looks like your singer is making a sound.

The names of the costumes aren't very helpful at the moment. Type into the text boxes of the costumes to change their names to 'not singing' and 'singing'.

Now that you have two different costumes for your singer, you can choose which costume is displayed! Add these two code blocks to your singer sprite:

```blocks3
이 스프라이트가를 클릭할 때
+(singing v) 로 의상을 바꾸기
(singer1 v) 음성을 완료 될 때까지 재생
+(노래가 아니라 v) 로 의상을 바꾸기
```

The code block for changing the costume is in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} section.

Click on your singer on the stage. Does she look like she is singing?

Now make your drum look like it's being hit!
