## Challenge: improving your drum

Can you change the sound that the drum makes when it's clicked?

Can you also get the drum to make a sound when the space bar is pressed? You'll need to use this `event`{:class="block3events"} block:

```blocks3
when [space v] key pressed
```

If you want to copy your existing code, right-click on it and then click on **duplicate**.
